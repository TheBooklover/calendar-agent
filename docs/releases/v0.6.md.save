# v0.6 — Frontend Demo UI + Guided README

## What shipped
- Added a simple frontend HTML UI that can:
  - Preview planning via API
  - Run an offline deterministic demo via `/demo/v05`
- Updated README so reviewers can quickly understand:
  - The deterministic baseline (V0.5) vs the UI demo (V0.6)
  - How to run the demo end-to-end

## Why it matters
This version makes the project easy to evaluate in under 2 minutes:
- The offline demo proves deterministic scheduling behavior without OAuth dependency.
- The preview flow demonstrates the real API contract used by the UI.

## How to demo quickly
1. Open the frontend HTML
2. Click **Offline Demo (V0.5)** to verify deterministic scheduling output
3. Click **Preview Plan** to exercise the live API preview flow
